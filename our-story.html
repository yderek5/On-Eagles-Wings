                    <h2 id = "Story">Our Story</h2>
                    <p class="intro">Throughout our journey serving with Carry The Cross Ministries our family has kept a dream in our hearts.
                      Our dream has been to start a farm, where children who are orphaned, at-risk, or in foster care would have a safe and loving family to call home.
                       A farm where families that have been broken or stained by the craziness of life, could come to find hope and restoration.</br>
                        A farm, where whomever needed a moment of peace, hope, joy and love; could come and find it.</br>
                         Over the years God has shaped, molded and trained our family in ways that would fit perfectly into this picture.
                         Thanks to Him we have experienced community living to its fullest with numerous families staying with us, much of the time having ten or more children in our building at a time.</br>
                       </br>
                          We have learned farming through tilling up our land and planting community gardens. We have been a place of hope and restoration, for those who came to stay or in the neighborhood who have had no hope. We have run a program where we took at risk youth to a farm to learn how to care for and ride horses.
                         We were even blessed with an opportunity to foster a young girl from the neighborhood whose family went through a period of brokenness. </p>
                    <p>As we began to research the need, we found In Kansas the number of children needing out of home care has increased from <b>5,852</b> in 2011 to <b>7,233</b> children in 2015.
                        In Missouri, the number has skyrocketed from <b>9220</b> to almost <b>13,000</b> today.
                        What stands out even more is that there were over <b>2,300</b> children in Kansas and <b>2,500</b> in Missouri that were without permanent homes.
                          Our hearts were broken as we dug deeper into those numbers.  The desire to do something to help was overwhelming. Our hope and prayer is that On Eagles Wings Farm would be a place of refuge, restoration and renewal and reintegration!
It will be a fully functioning, nearly self-sustainable farm complete with small-scale animals and crops, where children who are enduring hardships in life can come and visit or live in a Christ-centered family environment where they will be surrounded by love, encouragement, grace based discipline, intensive-family counseling and Christian morals and principals.
 Children who come to stay for long or short term will have full interaction with the farm environment. </p>

                <h4>Jason Neland</h4>
                <img class = "Board_pict" src="./images/Jason&Courtney.jpg">
                <p>The Executive Director of On Eagles Wings Farm is Jason Neland.
                   Jason is a graduate of Avila University with a BS in Natural Science/Biology and certification as a Secondary Teacher.
                  He is the co-founder of CTC and Director of The Firehouse in Kansas City, Kansas.
                  Jason will draw on his experience in many different walks of life to help guide him in transitioning to On Eagles Wings Farm.
                  He spent eight years as a youth and associate pastor, five years as a juvenile intake counselor working with at-risk and foster children, and the past ten years have been spent in the Kansas City,
                   KS public school system working as a teacher, mentor, and athletic coach for middle school football and high school baseball.</br>
                   Jason’s wife of fourteen years, Courtney, has also led a full life of serving her home, church and community.  She has served many years as a volunteer in youth ministries, worked as a Children’s Director at a church, has run a daycare out of her home and been a stay at home mom for not only her five children but for the many Firehouse and neighborhood children who have called their house a home.</br>
                   Jason and Courtney, have devoted their lives to investing in urban children and families for the past twelve years.  One of their highlights during this time was running a mentorship program for young men who had been arrested or runaway from home.  They brought them out to a farm each week to learn how to ride and care for horses and how to do work around the farm.  Their eyes were opened at this time as to how well “hardened” youth would respond to this new environment that they were in.  This is when the dream of having their own farm began to start taking shape.
