                    <p class="intro">Story throughout our journey serving with Carry The Cross Ministries our family has kept a dream in our hearts.
                      Our dream has been to start a farm, where children who are orphaned, at-risk, or in foster care would have a safe and loving family to call home.
                       A farm where families that have been broken or stained by the craziness of life, could come to find hope and restoration.
                        A farm, where whomever needed a moment of peace, hope, joy and love; could come and find it.</br>
                         Over the years God has shaped, molded and trained our family in ways that would fit perfectly into this picture.
                         Thanks to Him we have experienced community living to its fullest with numerous families staying with us, much of the time having ten or more children in our building at a time.</br>
                          We have learned farming through tilling up our land and planting community gardens. We have been a place of hope and restoration, for those who came to stay or in the neighborhood who have had no hope. We have run a program where we took at risk youth to a farm to learn how to care for and ride horses.
                         We were even blessed with an opportunity to foster a young girl from the neighborhood whose family went through a period of brokenness. </p>
                    <p>As we began to research the need, we found In Kansas the number of children needing out of home care has increased from 5,852 in 2011 to 7,233 children in 2015.  In Missouri, the number has skyrocketed from 9,220 to almost 13,000 today.  What stands out even more is that there were over 2,300 children in Kansas and 2,500 in Missouri that were without permanent homes.  Our hearts were broken as we dug deeper into those numbers.  The desire to do something to help was overwhelming. Our hope and prayer is that On Eagles Wings Farm would be a place of refuge, restoration and renewal and reintegration!
It will be a fully functioning, nearly self-sustainable farm complete with small-scale animals and crops, where children who are enduring hardships in life can come and visit or live in a Christ-centered family environment where they will be surrounded by love, encouragement, grace based discipline, intensive-family counseling and Christian morals and principals.  Children who come to stay for long or short term will have full interaction with the farm environment. </p>

                        <p>We discovered through research that both Kansas and Missouri have shown a significant increase in children needing out of home care. The statistics according to the Child Welfare League of America’s 2017 Report on the State of Welfare of Children in Kansas and Missouri in 2017 are overwhelming.</p>
