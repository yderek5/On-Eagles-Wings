                            <h3><strong>Pray</strong></h3>
                            <p>
                                First and foremost, our hope is to recruit as many 
                                people to faithfully pray for our ministry as we 
                                possibly can.  Pray that we would find land, for 
                                the children who will be coming to stay with us, 
                                and for the staff that will be serving. 
                                Sign up to be a prayer partner
                            </p>
                            <h3><strong>Volunteer</strong></h3>
                            <p>
                                    As we begin the process of bringing everything 
                                    together,  there are many areas where we could 
                                    use support.  One main area we are hoping to 
                                    expand on is making connections within our 
                                    community with businesses, programs, and churches 
                                    who would be interested in partnering with us as 
                                    we go through the process of opening the farm. 
                                    If you are interested in helping to network and 
                                    connect with our local community please get in 
                                    touch with us for further details.  We are also 
                                    searching for a fundraising coordinator so if you 
                                    have any experience in that field and would be 
                                    interested in helping to build a small non-profit 
                                    from ground level we would love to hear from you!
                            </p>
                            <h3><strong>Give</strong></h3>
                            <p>
                                    Our hope is to build a financial foundation that 
                                    will enable us to begin and continue in our ministry 
                                    to children debt free.  Whether you wish to offer a 
                                    one-time gift or to give on a monthly basis, a donation 
                                    in honor of or in memory, every penny will go to support 
                                    the daily needs of our children who will be staying with us. 
                                    We have many options for you to give.  If you wish to give in 
                                    a way other than what we have offered please contact us so we 
                                    can go over the details.
                            </p>
                            <h3><strong>Sponsor</strong></h3>
                            <p>
                                    Raising a child costs roughly around $13,000. The Restoration Club 
                                    gives donors an opportunity to sponsor a child for an entire year. 
                                    Our goal, as children come into our homes, is to provide a road towards 
                                    restoration, to provide hope that no matter what their situation has been, 
                                    that things can change for the better.  With your help you can help further 
                                    their restoration by providing for their physical and emotional well being! 
                                    Costs covered by your sponsorship will be: <strong>housing, food, insurance, clothing, and emotional and psychological needs.</strong>

                        <h3><strong>Our Hope</strong></h3>
                        <p class="text-left">
                            To provide an opportunity for your church to connect its members with local ministry opportunities including but not limited to:
                        </p>
                        <h3><strong>Adopt</strong></h3>
                        <p class='text-left'>
                            In the spirit of groups like Compassion and Big Brother Big Sister, OEWF will 
                            provide opportunities for families to connect with and choose a perspective 
                            child that they want to “adopt”.  They will then spend quality time with them 
                            either at the farm or within their own family context.  The goal will be to 
                            provide a positive connection point within our church community for each child 
                            where they will be loved, mentored, prayed for and modeled a positive family example.
                            Beyond connecting with the children who stay with us, there will be opportunities 
                            to “adopt” not just the children but their families as well in hopes of helping to 
                            provide a stable, Christian support system that will help guide them through the 
                            process of getting their children back.                                
                        </p>
                        <h3><strong>Build</strong></h3>
                        <p>
                            As a church community we will begin to rebuild and bridge the gap that is currently 
                            in place.  Scripturally we are encouraged many times over to be caregivers for the 
                            orphaned and those who cannot care for themselves.  As we grow our connections within 
                            our community and encourage our members to be more proactive in the foster care world, 
                            we will, reach out to, teach and unleash others into the community to do the same.
                            At our transitional living program shelter there will be opportunities for individuals 
                            or couples within the church to live and minister to our teenagers who age out of the 
                            system, leave the farm and join our transitional living program.  They will live in a 
                            fourplex and be mentors to the young adults who are staying there.  They will also 
                            have the opportunity to build and maintain relationships in the neighborhood that have 
                            been established for the past 13 years.    
                        </p>
                        <h3><strong>Connect</strong></h3>
                        <p>
                            Individuals within the church will have the opportunity to mentor with our children one 
                            on one.  Our mentors will connect on many different levels including spiritual, relational, 
                            educational and life skills. Individuals and Sunday School Groups will have the opportunity 
                            to sponsor events out at the farm including cookouts for our children and their families, 
                            trail riding with horses, barnyard activities, fishing days, vbs days, hiking on trails and 
                            camping out. Individuals within the church will have the opportunity to mentor and teach 
                            our children the skills that they possess either in life or career through seminars and 
                            training sessions. The youth of our church will have a retreat/camp environment to come to 
                            for a time of refreshing and renewal.  Students will be able to come out in small groups 
                            where they will have multiple options available including horseback riding, camping, fishing, 
                            and numerous volunteer opportunities around the farm.
