                            <h3 class="text-left"><strong>Goals for Phase 1: 2018-2020</strong></h3>
                        <ul class="text-left">

                            <li>Search for, secure and train mentors</li>
                            <li>Begin hosting foster/at-risk children and their families at the farm on weekends for farm related activities such as horseback riding and cook-outs.</li>
                            <li>Secure funds and begin building a second home on property</li>
                            <li>Search for and secure a family to live in home #2</li>
                            <li>Begin housing foster/at-risk girls ages 8-15</li>
                            <li>Begin teaching business skills to the children through the farm life. Sell farm and organic products at City Markets.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <hr>
                        <p>
                            During Phase 2 we will house boys and girls in separate homes who are in the foster care system ages 3-18. 
                            These children will be housed together in homes that have a married couple as house parents that are trained as counselors. 
                            Youth in these programs will also be trained in life and job skills in order to be prepared for life on their own or to continue 
                            on to college.
                        </p>
                        <h3><strong>Goals for Phase 2: 2020-2023</strong></h3>
                        <ul class="text-left">
                            <li>Continue hosting families</li>
                            <li>Secure funds and begin building a third home on the property</li>

                        <p>
                            During Phase 3 we will house children that are considered at-risk 
                            to enter into state custody.   They will stay for a designated amount 
                            of time that will be set up through a case manager. The main goal of the 
                            program will be to get these children back home by means of mandatory family 
                            counseling and life skills training.  One of the requirements for staying at 
                            the farm will be that both parents and children will be involved in at least 
                            weekly mediation and counseling.
                        </p>

                        <ul class="text-left">
                            <li>Continue hosting families</li>

                        <h2><strong>The Homes</strong></h2>
                        <h3><strong>Building 1: The Main House</strong></h3>
                        <p>
                            This would be the home that the farms executive director and his 
                            family live.  This home would be a place where teen mothers stay 
                            as well as a place for foster children who need temporary placement, 
                            especially family groups of two or more or are in PPC/Police Protective 
                            Custody.  Weekly meetings and dinners would also occur here giving 
                            everyone working on the farm an opportunity to get together and communicate.  
                            This home will hopefully already be established on the farm when it is acquired.  
                            The other buildings, if not already established, will be built once the funds are 
                            there to complete the project. 
                        </p>
                        <h3><strong>Building 2: Sibling Group Home</strong></h3>
                        <p>
                            This would be the home where sibling groups that are in state custody would stay 
                            until they are reunited back with their families or adopted by a family. Youth 
                            in this home will be given the opportunity to be homeschooled or go to a Christian 
                            school during the school year. There will be a limit of eight beds in this home 
                            where permanent house parents will live with the youth. Each youth will have a 
                            case plan outlined that the house parents will use as a guideline.
                        </p>
                        <h3><strong>Building 3: Girls Home</strong></h3>
                        <p>
                            This would be the home where girls that are in state custody would stay until they 
                            are reunited back with their families, adopted by a family or turn eighteen and are 
                            ready to go either to college or out on their own. Youth in this home will be given 
                            the opportunity to be homeschooled or go to a Christian school during the school year. 
                            There will be a limit of eight beds in this home where permanent house parents will live 
                            with the youth.  The main job of the parents will be to provide a loving Christian based 
                            home environment.  Each youth will have a case plan outlined that the house parents will 
                            use as a guideline. If a teen ages out of the foster care system while still with us, 
                            they will have been given the tools needed to be on their own but always welcomed as 
                            family. 
                        </p>
                        <h3><strong>Building 4: Boys Home</strong></h3>
                        <p>
                            This would be the home where boys that are in state custody would stay until they are reunited 
                            back with their families, adopted by a family or turn eighteen and are ready to go either to college
                             or out on their own. Youth in this home will be given the opportunity to be homeschooled or go to 
                             a Christian school during the school year. There will be a limit of eight beds in this home where 
                             permanent house parents will live with the youth.  The main job of the parents will be to provide 
                             a loving Christian based home environment.  Each youth will have a case plan outlined that the house 
                             parents will use as a guideline.  If a teen ages out of the foster care system while still with us, 
                             they will have been given the tools needed to be on their own but always welcomed as family. 
                        </p>
                        <h3><strong>Building 5: Temporary Home</strong></h3>
                        <p>
                                This home will be for kids ages 7-16 who are “troubled”, “at-risk” or “runaways” and have been 
                                placed into our up to six month long but as short as one month long programs.  Youth in 
                                this home will be given the opportunity to be homeschooled or go to a Christian school 
                                during the school year.  Permanent house parents will also reside in this home and 
                                perform the same functions as the boys and girls home.  Each youth will have a case plan 
                                outlined that the house parents will use as a guideline.  House parents, farm directors 
                                and youth’s parents will work together with the goal in mind of getting the child back 
                                into the home in a positive way in a reasonable amount of time. 
                        </p>
                        <h3><strong>Building 6: The Barn, Stable and Riding Facilities</strong></h3>
                        <p>
                            The barn will perform typical barn functions.  It will be used as a place of storage for farm 
                            equipment and also as a home for some of the animals.  Educational activities will also 
                            take place here.  Equine therapy will be done in these areas where our children will 
                            learn how to care for, interact with and ride our horses.  This will also be an area where 
                            families will come and spend time together.
                        </p>
                        <h3><strong>Building 7: Recreation Center and Chapel</strong></h3>
                        <p>
                            This building would have a gym with a basketball court that would also be used as a 
                            chapel area.   Many different activities could be included in the gym area such 
                            as a rock climbing wall, volleyball, and other sports activities.  The gym would 
                            also be used a facility to hold community type functions as well as where all of the 
                            parents of the kids housed on the farm come for a monthly celebration.  This would 
                            also have a kitchen and dining area.
